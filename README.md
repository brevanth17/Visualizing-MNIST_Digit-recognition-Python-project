# Visualizing-MNIST_Digit-recognition-Python-project
This project explores and visualizes the classic MNIST handwritten digits dataset. The goal is to understand the dataset structure, prepare the data for modeling, and create meaningful visualizations to observe patterns within handwritten digits.

🔍 What this project includes
	•	Importing essential Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
	•	Loading and preprocessing the MNIST training and test datasets
	•	Separating features and labels for training and testing
	•	Inspecting dataset shape and characteristics
	•	Visualizing sample handwritten digit images using Matplotlib
	•	Basic preparation steps for digit-recognition machine learning models

🎯 Purpose
This project serves as an introduction to:
	•	Understanding data preprocessing steps for ML models
	•	Visualizing high-dimensional image data (784 pixels per image → 28×28 reshaping)
	•	Setting the foundation for later ML tasks like classification using models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, or Neural Networks

🧠 Skills Demonstrated
	•	Python data handling
	•	Data preprocessing
	•	Data visualization
	•	Understanding pixel-based image representation
	•	Basic machine learning workflow for classification problems
